This repository represents an ongoing and ever-growing collection of examples as they relate to web standards.  There is a little bit of everything here from CSS to Arduino hardware integration.  I make no effort to update or maintain these examples as the standards move forward, unless I need them for a presentation.  Refactoring happens on the examples when those opportunities present themselves.

NOTE: The indicator of "TBD" is an application that is purely conceptual at this point.  Some art may have been gathered.  Pieces of UI inspiration.  Or perhaps code snippets from past projects.  The contents of these directories may not even be web standards content at this point.

NOTE: Various indicators exist on the following list to help jog my memory as to what is there and what I originally intended to do with the application.  A "stepped" indicator is for samples small enough to be worked through in a hands-on session.  The "instructional" designation is generally content that supported video tutorials.  And a "vision" tag is fringe experimental content whose code may or may not be crap, but whose result carries immediate impact.
